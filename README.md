# Location_Based_Taxi_aggregator_and_selector

### 1\. **System Design and Technology Stack**

**Basic Components**:
---------------------

*   **Backend**: Node.js or Python Flask for API development.
*   **Database**: MongoDB or Amazon DocumentDB for geospatial queries.
*   **Server/Deployment**: AWS EC2 instances for hosting the application and AWS Lambda + API Gateway for serverless API execution.

**Technology Choices**:
-----------------------

*   **AWS IoT Core** for real-time location updates from taxis.
*   **Amazon S3**: Store logs and user data that don’t need real-time access.
*   **Amazon Cognito** for user authentication.

### 2\. **Project Execution Plan**

**Phase 1: Initial Setup and Configuration**
--------------------------------------------

*   **Area Definition**: Define the service area with latitude and longitude boundaries.
*   **Database Setup**: Configure MongoDB with geospatial indexing.
*   **API Development**: Develop APIs for taxi and user registration, and another set for updating and retrieving location data.

**Phase 2: Simulator Development**
----------------------------------

*   **Taxi Simulator**: Create a simulator for 50 taxis, generating lat/long coordinates within the specified area, updating their position every minute.
*   **User Simulator**: Develop a simulation for at least 5 users making random taxi requests based on location and taxi type.

**Phase 3: API and Core Functionality**
---------------------------------------

*   **Data Ingestion**: Implement AWS Lambda functions to handle incoming location updates from the taxi simulator.
*   **Request Handling**: Develop logic to retrieve the closest taxis based on user location and preferences using MongoDB’s geospatial queries.

**Phase 4: Intermediate Milestone**
-----------------------------------

*   **Data Visualization**: Implement functionality to visually display taxi locations and user requests, perhaps using a simple frontend or through AWS QuickSight for more advanced visualizations.

**Phase 5: Advanced Features and Optimization**
-----------------------------------------------

*   **Real-Time Visualization**: Integrate a real-time dashboard to show taxi and demand distribution.
*   **Dynamic Dispatch Algorithm**: Implement an algorithm to suggest optimal positions for taxis based on historical demand data.

**Phase 6: Final Deliverables**
-------------------------------

*   **Documentation**: Prepare comprehensive documentation including a README file, code comments, and API documentation.
*   **Demo**: Create a screencast or series of screenshots demonstrating the functionality.
*   **Presentation**: Develop a slide deck outlining the project scope, architecture, key challenges, and outcomes.

### 3\. **Testing and Validation**

*   **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each API and backend logic to ensure they work as expected.
*   **Integration Testing**: Test the entire system flow from taxi location updates to user request handling and response generation.
*   **Performance Testing**: Simulate high load scenarios to ensure the system performs well during peak times.

### 4\. **Evaluation and Improvement**

*   **Feedback Sessions**: Regular check-ins with your mentor and peer reviews.
*   **Performance Metrics**: Monitor AWS CloudWatch for performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed.
