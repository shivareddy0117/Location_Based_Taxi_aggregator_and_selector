# Location-Based Taxi Aggregator and Selector

## Project Overview
The Taxi Co-Op wants to build a competing solution to existing cab aggregators while keeping the power in the hands of users and drivers. This project involves developing a system to store real-time cab locations and respond to demands from customers based on proximity matches with available drivers. The solution includes a taxi simulator, user simulator, and APIs to handle various operations, along with a web-based UI for interaction.

## Features
- **Taxi and User Registration**: Register new taxis and users with unique IDs.
- **Real-time Location Updates**: Taxis transmit their locations periodically.
- **User Requests**: Users can request taxis based on location and type preference.
- **Proximity Matching**: Respond to user requests with a list of closest taxis.
- **Visualization**: Map-based visualization of taxi locations using Folium.
- **Web UI**: Interactive web interface for submitting taxi requests and viewing results.
